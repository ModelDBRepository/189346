This is the readme for the Brian code associated with the paper:<p/>

Kim CM, Nykamp DQ (2017) The influence of depolarization block on seizure-like activity in networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. J Comput Neurosci 43:65-79<br/>
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10827-017-0647-7">http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10827-017-0647-7</a><p/>

This code was contributed by Dr CM Kim. <p/>

The code requires the Brian (python package) simulator which is freely available from 
<a href="http://briansimulator.org">http://briansimulator.org</a><p/>

Once Brian is installed, the simulations can be started with commands like:<p/>
python fig2-fi.py
<p/>
After a minute or so you should see a couple of figures:<p/>
<img src="./figure_1.png" alt="figure 1" width="550">
<img src="./figure_2.png" alt="figure 2" width="550">
